# ü§ñ CareConnect - Healthcare Patient Management App

CareConnect is a modern healthcare patient management application built using Next.js and Appwrite. This app enables patients to register, book, and manage their appointments with doctors. It also provides administrators with tools for scheduling, confirming, and canceling appointments, along with SMS notifications using Twilio.

This is a learning-based project that I made while trying to learn Next.js, Appwrite, and ShadCN.
